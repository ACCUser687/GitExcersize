Henry had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Henry went,
the lamb was sure to go.
 
It followed her to school one day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
to see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently about,
till Henry did appear.

“Why does the lamb love Henry so?”
the eager children cry.

“Why, Henry loves the lamb, you know.”
the teacher did reply
